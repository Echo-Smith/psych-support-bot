        "Key interventions: (1) Build structure and routine immediately. "

        "(3) Challenge hopeless thoughts using thought records. "
        "(4) Reduce withdrawal gradually through scheduling social contact. "

        "If awake for more than 20 minutes, leave the bed and return when sleepy. "
        "(3) Sleep restriction: limit time in bed to actual sleep time to build sleep pressure. "

        "Key interventions during a panic attack: "
        "(1) Ground immediately using 5-4-3-2-1 senses. "
        "(2) Slow down breathing deliberately. The body is already getting enough oxygen. "

        "Identifying the primary emotion reduces anger intensity. "
        "(2) Anger increases with physical arousal. Slowing the body slows the anger. "
        "(3) Anger makes thinking more rigid. Decisions made in anger are usually regretted. "
        "Interventions: (1) Time out: create physical distance before responding. "
        "(2) Physiological cooling: cold water, slow breathing, muscle relaxation. "
        "(3) Reframe: what is the unmet need beneath the anger? "
        "(4) Assertive communication: express needs clearly without aggression. "
