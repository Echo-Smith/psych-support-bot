## Suggested Execution Order

1. Repository skeleton and dependency setup
2. FastAPI app and config system
3. Pydantic contracts and AI state schemas
4. LangGraph workflow skeleton
5. Risk classifier and crisis routing
6. Persistence layer and migrations
7. Core conversation API
8. Assessments and check-ins
9. Tracing and evaluation harness
10. Weekly summaries and intervention plans

## Definition of Done for MVP Foundation

- FastAPI service starts locally
- Conversation endpoint runs through LangGraph
- Risk classification always executes before normal response generation
- Crisis mode blocks normal support flow when required
- Core entities persist to PostgreSQL
- Basic tracing is visible in Langfuse
- Offline evaluation command can run predefined safety cases

### 2026-08-26 (P1 Complete)

- Moved `index.html` to `dev/index.html` (development version retained)
- Created `docs/technical/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` — strict 6-gate release standard (100% pass required)
- Added Langfuse `trace_span` instrumentation on all 8 LangGraph nodes (risk_classifier, intent_router, consultation_planner, memory_loader, knowledge_loader, response_generator, safety_reviewer, summary_writer)
- Created `src/psych_support_bot/evals/judge.py` — LLM-as-judge C-layer evaluation:
  - 4 dimensions: attribution_safety, boundary, empathy, action_appropriateness (1-5 scale)
  - Judge model: DeepSeek-V4-Flash via dedicated API endpoint
  - `score_reply()` — single-case judge scoring with JSON output parsing
  - `run_judge_eval()` — batch judge over B-layer results
  - `export_human_judge_table()` — Markdown scorecard for manual review
  - Langfuse trace span `judge.llm_invoke` for observability
- Created `tests/evals/test_judge.py` — 5 basic tests + 1 smoke test (all passing)
- Updated `EVAL_GUIDE.md` with C-layer documentation (positioning, 4 dimensions, judge config, execution flow, relationship to B-layer)
- Created `EVAL_REPORT_JUDGE.md` — C-layer evaluation report template (pending first run)
- Filled 3 intervention plan templates in `domain/plans/templates.py`:
  - `anxiety_management_7day` — CBT-based daily actions + reflection prompts
  - `sleep_hygiene_7day` — ISI-aligned daily sleep routines
  - `mood_monitoring_7day` — PHQ-9 tracking + behavioral activation
- Implemented `PlanEnrollment` DB model + plans service + API routes (enrollment, progress query, daily completion toggle)
- All 54 unit tests + 6 judge tests passing; lint clean
