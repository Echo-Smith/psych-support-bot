# AI Psychological Support Bot Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

- Project name: AI Psychological Support Bot
- Product type: Digital mental health support system for users with mild-to-moderate symptoms or early warning signs
- Primary goal: Deliver structured psychological support, symptom screening, guided self-help interventions, and strong safety triage
- Product boundary: The system does not provide diagnosis, emergency intervention, or replacement for psychiatrists or licensed therapists

## 2. Target Users

### Included users

- Users with mild-to-moderate anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, panic-related distress, emotional dysregulation, or early warning signs of psychological illness
- Users with prior diagnosis but currently stable and seeking structured support, check-ins, and self-help tools

### Excluded from normal flow

- Users with active suicidal intent, self-harm plans, homicidal intent, psychotic symptoms, mania with severe impairment, or other complex/high-risk presentations

### High-risk handling principle

- Provide brief stabilization support only
- Immediately recommend medical care, crisis resources, and real-world support contacts
- Do not continue normal counseling-style deep conversation

## 3. Product Positioning

- External positioning: AI psychological support and self-help intervention assistant
- Internal positioning: Workflow-driven mental health support platform with screening, structured conversation, intervention plans, tracking, and risk routing
- Core value:
  - Early identification of symptom patterns
  - Structured support inspired by counseling flow
  - Measurable symptom improvement support
  - Strong safety boundaries and crisis routing

## 4. Recommended AI Development Framework

### Core framework decision

- Primary AI workflow framework: `LangGraph`
- API service framework: `FastAPI`
- Structured data and validation: `Pydantic`
- Primary database: `PostgreSQL`
- Vector search for RAG and memory retrieval: `pgvector` for MVP, optional `Qdrant` later
- Cache and session support: `Redis`
- Async jobs: `Celery`
- Observability and prompt tracing: `Langfuse`

### Why this stack fits this product

- The product is workflow-heavy, not agent-first
- Safety routing and state transitions must be explicit and testable
- Risk assessment, intervention selection, response generation, and summarization should be independently observable
- Structured outputs are required for safe routing and auditable behavior

### Development principles

- Workflow first
- Safety first
- Structured output first
- Human-readable state transitions
- Evaluation before scale

## 5. High-Level System Architecture

### User-facing layers

- Mobile app as the primary launch platform
- Web landing page for information and onboarding
- Internal admin/ops panel later for reviewing risk events, content quality, and analytics

### Backend services

- Auth and user profile service
- Conversation service
- Screening and assessment service
- Intervention plan service
- Check-in and progress tracking service
- Report generation service
- Crisis resource and routing service

### AI orchestration layer

- Input preprocessing node
- Risk classifier node
- Intent router node
- Memory retrieval node
- Tool selector node
- Response generation node
- Safety reviewer node
- Summary and memory writer node

### Data layer

- Relational data in PostgreSQL
- Semantic retrieval via pgvector
- Transient state and caching in Redis
- Async event processing via Celery workers

## 6. AI Workflow Design

### Primary conversation flow

1. Receive user message
2. Load user state, memory summary, and recent risk flags
3. Run risk classification first
4. If high risk, route to crisis mode immediately
5. If not high risk, classify conversation intent
6. Select conversation strategy
7. Retrieve relevant memory and optional knowledge/tool context
8. Generate draft response with the main LLM
9. Run safety and boundary review
10. Return response to user
11. Asynchronously save summary, memory updates, and analytics

### Conversation modes

- `support_mode`: emotional support, reflective listening, light structure
- `assessment_mode`: screening-oriented conversation and symptom clarification
- `intervention_mode`: CBT/ACT/DBT/behavioral activation guidance
- `planning_mode`: next steps, daily tasks, and short-term goals
- `crisis_mode`: immediate stabilization and referral guidance

## 7. Psychological Method Stack

### Primary methods for MVP

- CBT for thought patterns, symptom maintenance, and structured exercises
- ACT for acceptance, cognitive defusion, and values-oriented action
- DBT skills for distress tolerance and emotion regulation
- Behavioral activation for low motivation and depressive slowing

### Delivery format

- Strategy cards per method
- Trigger conditions for using each method
- Contraindications and escalation boundaries
- Reusable exercise templates
- Structured conversation prompts by mode

## 8. Safety and Risk Framework

### Risk levels

- `L0`: no evident risk
- `L1`: distress present, no acute danger
- `L2`: elevated concern, more assessment needed
- `L3`: high risk, normal flow blocked
- `L4`: emergency-risk indicators, immediate urgent guidance

### High-risk triggers

- Suicide or self-harm statements
- Homicidal intent
- Hallucination or delusion indicators
- Mania-like behavior with severe sleep loss or impaired judgment
- Loss of control with strong danger cues

### Crisis handling rules

- Short, direct, stabilizing language only
- Encourage immediate real-world support contact
- Recommend hospital, emergency services, or crisis resources
- Do not continue exploratory counseling flow

## 14. Evaluation Strategy

### Offline evaluation before launch

- Empathy quality
- Core problem identification
- Intervention appropriateness
- Actionability of suggestions
- Safety compliance
- High-risk recall performance

### Scenario coverage

## 16. Immediate Build Priorities

### Completed (Phase 0 + 1 + 1.5)

1. ~~Initialize repository structure~~
2. ~~Set up FastAPI app and configuration management~~
3. ~~Define Pydantic schemas for risk, routing, memory, and responses~~
4. ~~Build first LangGraph conversation workflow~~
5. ~~Implement risk classifier contract and placeholder adapters~~
6. ~~Add PostgreSQL models and migrations~~
7. ~~Add Redis and Celery integration~~
8. ~~Add tracing with Langfuse (node-level trace_span on all 8 nodes)~~
9. ~~Create evaluation dataset format (A/B/C three-layer)~~
10. ~~Build first end-to-end conversation API~~
11. ~~Safety hardening: pathological attribution / experience denial / over-pathologization regex red lines~~
12. ~~Graceful degradation + context-aware fallback~~
13. ~~Release safety checklist (6-gate 100% standard)~~
14. ~~LLM-as-judge C-layer evaluation (DeepSeek-V4-Flash, 4-dimension scoring)~~
15. ~~Intervention plan daily content (3 × 7-day templates + PlanEnrollment DB model)~~

### Next (Phase 2)

16. pgvector semantic retrieval — improve metaphor expression matching
17. LLM model routing + fallback — lightweight model for simple support, strong model for complex consultation
18. Knowledge base Chinese sources — supplement authoritative Chinese psychology content
19. Redis/Celery async tasks — async summary write, scheduled weekly report generation
20. Exhaustion subtype differentiation — physical fatigue / emotional exhaustion / relationship fatigue / anticipatory anxiety
21. Semantic memory retrieval — prevent context loss beyond 3 sessions

## 17. Non-Negotiable Rules for Future Work

- Never let standard support flow bypass risk classification
- Never allow high-risk users to remain in normal intervention mode
- Never rely on a single unstructured prompt for safety decisions
- Every critical AI step must have structured outputs
- Every release must pass safety regression tests
